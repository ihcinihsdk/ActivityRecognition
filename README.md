Document on Activity Recognition project
========================================

Goal
----
With a large amount of data about personal activity collected by devices, it is interesting not only to quantify how much a particular activity a person does, but also to quantify how well he does it. In this task, given a large amount of labeled data which describe accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of six participants, and whether they are performing barbell lifts correctly or incorrectly (if incorrectly, what mistake they have made), we would like to train a system which automatically tells us for new data how a person is performing.
